# ReACT - TKG (Reasoning Action Agent for Threat Knowledge Graph)

## 🔍 Overview

**ReACT - TKG** is a research-focused project that integrates a multi-agent reasoning-acting framework using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). It is designed to interact with a threat-focused **Knowledge Graph** stored in **Neo4j**, enabling intelligent querying and refinement of user queries through Large Language Models (LLMs).

This system leverages the power of **reasoning and acting agents** to provide insightful, accurate, and context-aware responses to cybersecurity-related queries.

## 🧠 Core Features

- 🔁 **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Designed using LangGraph to simulate collaborative agents with distinct reasoning and acting roles.
- 📚 **LLM-Driven Reasoning**: Refines queries using large language models to ensure semantic understanding and contextual relevance.
- 🕸️ **Neo4j GraphDB Integration**: Interfaces with a threat intelligence Knowledge Graph for real-time, queryable insights.
- 🧪 **Research-Grade Pipeline**: Built as part of an academic/research initiative into reasoning over cybersecurity knowledge.
